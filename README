A library for decoding Ogg/Vorbis audio. So far it's nowhere near
the decoding stage, but it can access comments (tags):

(with-ogg-stream (stream "~/01_expander.ogg")
  (read-value 'vorbis stream)
  (comments (read-value 'vorbis stream)))
=>
(:ARTIST "The Future Sound of London" :TITLE "Expander" :ALBUM "Accelerator"
 :DATE "1996" :TRACKNUMBER "1")
